Executive Deployment Guide (Render.com)

This guide will deploy your To-Do application to Render.com using a PostgreSQL database. This ensures your data persists and the application looks professional for your resume.

Prerequisites

GitHub Account: Your code must be pushed to a GitHub repository.

Render Account: Sign up at render.com.

Step 1: Push to GitHub

Ensure your repository structure looks like this:
/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── Procfile
├── templates/
└── static/

Step 2: Create the Database (Render)

Click "New +" and select "PostgreSQL".

Name: todo-db (or similar).

Region: Choose the one closest to you (e.g., Singapore/Frankfurt).

Plan: Select "Free".

Click "Create Database".

Wait for it to initialize. Once done, copy the "Internal Database URL".

Step 3: Create the Web Service (Render)

Click "New +" and select "Web Service".

Connect your GitHub repository.

Name: arjun-taskmaster (this will be your URL: arjun-taskmaster.onrender.com).

Runtime: Python 3.

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: gunicorn app:app

Plan: Select "Free".

Step 4: Environment Variables

Scroll down to the "Environment Variables" section in the Web Service setup:

Key: PYTHON_VERSION | Value: 3.9.0 (or your local version)

Key: SECRET_KEY     | Value: (Generate a random string)

Key: DATABASE_URL   | Value: (Paste the Internal Database URL from Step 2)

Step 5: Deploy

Click "Create Web Service".

Render will clone your repo, install dependencies, and start Gunicorn.

Once the logs say "Build successful" and "Starting service", your resume project is live.

Why this works for your resume:

Persistence: Recruiters can create accounts and tasks, and they will remain there if they return later.

Professionalism: HTTPS is enabled by default.

Code Quality: The code automatically handles the switch between local SQLite and production Postgres.
